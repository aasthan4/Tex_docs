\section{Restricted Hartree Fock Solution}
	%define basis and form MOs
	For minimum basis $H_2$ we have two 2s orbitals, one on each H atom as our basis.
	i.e $\phi_A$ and $\psi_B$ as atomic orbitals on hydrogen atom A and B. Let $\bar{\phi_A}$ and $\bar{\phi_B}$
	denote the $\beta$ spin. \\
	Restricted Hartree Fock orbitals will be determined by pure symmetry considerations.\\ 
	$\phi_{\sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+S_{12}}}(\phi_A+\phi_B)$\\	
	$\phi_{\sigma}^*=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+S_{12}}}(\phi_A+\phi_B)$\\
	The determinant then is\\
	$|\phi_{\sigma}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma}>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}matrix$\\
	$|\phi_{\sigma}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma}>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}matrix$\\
	The energy of this determinant based on applying the Fock operator will be $2h_{\sigma \sigma} + J_{\sigma \sigma}$
	where h is the core 1 electron part and J is the columbing 2 electron integral. Let us evaluate the energy based on atomic orbitals.\\

	To correctly describe the dissociation limit, energy of dissoiated $H_2$ molecule should go to two times energy of $H$ atom. The energy calculated by RHF is an overestimation by $J_{\sigma \sigma}$. 
	$J_{\sigma \sigma}$ should go to zero for correct description which it doesnt as shown below. \\
	$J_{\sigma \sigma}=$\\
	
	\subsection{Discussion of results}
	%discuss the source of the problem
	If we look at equation x carefully we find that there are four determinants contributing to the molecular configuration, two of which are ionic in nature (1 and 4th). 
	These determinants do not contribute to the correct dissociated $H_2$ atoms as the atomic orbitals are spacially separated. RHF molecular orbitals are unable to include this spacial separation as they 
	include same spacial $\Psi$ for both spin $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Thus we need additional degree of fredom in our orbital wavefunction to include different spacial wavefunctions for spin states. An Unrestricted 
	Hartree Fock (UHF) can solve this problem discussed in the next section. \\
\section{Unrestricted Hartree Fock Solution}
	Restricted set of orbitals were generated purely by symmetry. Unrestricted orbitals are generated through adding additional degree of freedom to make sure the spacial part of the orbitals wavefunction 
	can be relaxed. A formulation for $H_2$ minimal basis case is described below. \\
	We know that in the dissociated state $H_2$ minimal basis configuration will be $|\phi_A \bar{\phi}_B>$ where \phi_a and \phi_B are atomic orbitals of $H$ atoms. We can thus relax our RHF orbitals in such a way that they 
	finally form the above configuration at the dissociation limit. \\

	Let us consider the dissociated case of $H_2$ molecule and calculate its energy and wavefunction associated with it. \\
	
	\subsection{Discussion}
	The energy calculated above through the unrestricted wavefunction is matches our understanding of two dissociated H atoms. Although the unrestricted solution wavefunction $|\phi_A \phi_B> $ at the dissociation limit is not a pure spin 
	spin state and thus a wrong solution to the correct wavefucntion. Hartree Fock is a single determinant theory, and it finds a set of spin orbitals \Ki_A such that the single determinant produced is the best possible approximation to
	ground state of an N electron system. But as we shall discuss in the next section, the correct solution to $H_2$ dissociation at the dossociation limit is not a single determinant. \\

	\subsection{Spin Operator}
	Spin Operator is a vector quantity defined as follows :
	$\vv{s}=s_x \vv{i}+s_y\vv{j} + s_z\vv{k}$\\
	The x, y and z components are defined as observed experimentally through the Glen Fredlich experiment. 
	$s_x=$\\
	$s_y=$\\
	$s_z=$\\
	A more convenient notation used is to define ladder operators
	$s_+=s_x+is_y$\\
	$s_-=s_x-is_y$\\
	The action of these ladder operators can be seen as taking the spin state up the ladder through $s_+$ and down the ladder through $s_-$.\\
	The x,y and z components of the spin operator do not commute with each other.\\
	$\[s_x,s_y\]=i\h$
	$\[s_x,s_y\]=i\h$
	$\[s_x,s_y\]=i\h$
	The action of these operators can be seen on spin states defined by $\alpha$ or (1,0) in matrix notation  and $\beta$ or (0,1).	
	Their operators can also be defined through Pauli matrices.
	$s_x=\matrix{}{}$
	$s_x=\matrix{}{}$
	$s_x=\matrix{}{}$
	$s_+$
	$s_-$
	The action of these matrices on the vector form of spin state gives the resulting spin state vector. Such as :
	$s_x |\alpha>=()()=$
	Through the above action we can come up with the following relations. 
	$s_+|\alpha>=0  s_-|\alpha>=|\beta>$
	$s_+|\beta>=|\alpha>  s_-|\beta>=0$
	The above definitions are valid for atomic orbitals. The following set of derivations  can be made for molecular orbitals. 
	S
	
	Since $S^2$ commutes with $H$, exact molecular orbitals are also eigenfunctions of $S^2$ operators and called pure spin states. Since we use an approximate solution
	to wave function, our wavefunction $\Psi$ can be at times not a pure spin state. In such cases we can make the wavefunction pure spin states by taking a linear combination
	of wavefunctions produced. 
	\subsection{Spin Adapted Configurations}
	Let us consider the example of $H_2$ to illustrate spin adapted configurations. The ground state of $H_2$ will have $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons in its lowest energy 
	molecular orbital. 
\section{Configurational Interaction Solution}
	One way to look at our RHF solution of $H_2$ dissociation is to follow the two molecular orbitals produced $\phi_{\sigma}$ and $\phi_{sigma^*}$. 
	The energy of configuration $|\phi_{\sigma} \bar{\phi}_{\sigma}$ is $2h_{\sigma} +J_{\sigma \sigma}$ and of configuration $|\phi_{\sigma^*} \bar{\phi}_{\sigma^*}$ is $2h_{\sigma^*} +J_{\sigma^* \sigma^*}$. If we expand the molecular orbitals and write the energy in terms of atomic orbitals, \\
	$2h_{\sigma} +J_{\sigma \sigma}=h_AA+h_AB+h_BA+h_BB+J_AA+J_BB$\\
	$2h_{\sigma} +J_{\sigma \sigma}=h_AA-h_AB-h_BA+h_BB_J_AA+J_BB$\\
	At the equilibrium distance, |\phi_{\sigma}> is clearly lower in energy but at the dissociation limit, $lim_{r->\inf} h_AB=h_BA=0$. Thus the two states
	become degenerate. HF only calculating the energy of one of these states i.e $\phi_{\sigma}$. The energy is even minimised by what is known as the non-
	dynamic correlation. One method to deal with this psudo degeneracy is by taking a linear combination of the two states and using Configuration Interaction 
	to solve at the dissociated state. \\
	$|\Phi>=c1 |\phi_{\sigma}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma}>+c2|\phi_{\sigma^*}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma^*}>$\\
	\matrix{}{}{} equation\\
	where the Hamiltonian coupling terms are :
	$H12$ all \\
	$E=c1H1$
	We have an energy equation constrained by the normalisation equation $<\Phi|\Phi>=1$ which gives us $c1^2+c2^2=1$.
	To solve for the minimum in energy based on the above constraint, we form the Lagrange function and find the minimum. 
	$L=$
	The above equation gives us 4 equations.
