\section{Restricted Hartree Fock Solution}
	%define basis and form MOs
	For minimum basis $H_2$ we have two 2s orbitals, one on each H atom as our basis.
	i.e $\phi_A$ and $\psi_B$ as atomic orbitals on hydrogen atom A and B. Let $\bar{\phi_A}$ and $\bar{\phi_B}$
	denote the $\beta$ spin. \\
	Restricted Hartree Fock orbitals will be determined by pure symmetry considerations.\\ 
	$\phi_{\sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+S_{12}}}(\phi_A+\phi_B)$\\	
	$\phi_{\sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+S_{12}}}(\phi_A+\phi_B)$\\
	The determinant then is\\
	$|\phi_{\sigma}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma}>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}matrix$\\
	$|\phi_{\sigma}\bar{\phi}_{\sigma}>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}matrix$\\
	The energy of this determinant based on applying the Fock operator will be $2h_{\sigma \sigma} + J_{\sigma \sigma}$
	where h is the core 1 electron part and J is the columbing 2 electron integral. Let us evaluate the energy based on atomic orbitals.\\
	determinant ->
	To correctly describe the dissociation limit, energy of dissoiated $H_2$ molecule should go to two times energy of $H$ atom. The energy calculated by RHF is an overestimation by $J_{\sigma \sigma}$. 
	$J_{\sigma \sigma}$ should go to zero for correct description which it doesnt as shown below. \\
	$J_{\sigma \sigma}=$\\
	
	\subsection{Discussion of results}
	%discuss the source of the problem
	If we look at equation x carefully we find that there are four determinants contributing to the molecular configuration, two of which are ionic in nature (1 and 4th). 
	These determinants do not contribute to the correct dissociated $H_2$ atoms as the atomic orbitals are spacially separated. RHF molecular orbitals are unable to include this spacial separation as they 
	include same spacial $\Psi$ for both spin $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Thus we need additional degree of fredom in our orbital wavefunction to include different spacial wavefunctions for spin states. An Unrestricted 
	Hartree Fock (UHF) can solve this problem discussed in the next section. \\
\section{Unrestricted Hartree Fock Solution}
	Restricted set of orbitals were generated purely by symmetry. Unrestricted orbitals are generated through adding additional degree of freedom to make sure the spacial part of the orbitals wavefunction 
	can be relaxed. A formulation for $H_2$ minimal basis case is described below. \\
	We know that in the dissociated state $H_2$ minimal basis configuration will be $|\phi_A \bar{\phi}_B>$ where \phi_a and \phi_B are atomic orbitals of $H$ atoms. We can thus relax our RHF orbitals in such a way that they 
	finally form the above configuration at the dissociation limit. \\

	Let us consider the dissociated case of $H_2$ molecule and calculate its energy and wavefunction associated with it. \\
